# PythonProject
Hello everyone,
This project is a graphical user interface, or GUI, for a flight reservation system. Given certain time constraints, I was unable to add 3 aspects of the project. First, I wanted to portray the current database values in the GUI. In addition to this, I would like to have the database update in real time as the user adds/cancels different aspectsof the flight system. Finally, I wanted to add topmenu bars for the toolbar that could lead to quicker access to the desired window. 

Included in the project is the necessary image for the background photo, in addition to a dump of the SQL Database that I used to communicate with the code. 
The image does not belong to me, nor does any of these materials in regards to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

Thanks for looking at my project!
